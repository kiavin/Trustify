Trustify - A Blockchain-based Escrow Platform
Welcome to Trustify, the blockchain-based escrow service that ensures secure and transparent transactions between buyers and sellers. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Trustify guarantees a safe environment for online exchanges where funds are only released once both parties are satisfied.

üåê Live Project: Trustify Escrow Platform

üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview
Trustify is designed to reduce the risks of online transactions. Whether you're buying goods or services, this platform ensures that the buyer's money is held securely until the agreed terms are fulfilled by the seller. Trustify operates seamlessly using blockchain technology to manage the escrow process, ensuring that all transactions are immutable, secure, and decentralized.

Why Blockchain?
Security: Transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger.
Transparency: Both parties can track the status of their escrow in real time.
Decentralization: No intermediaries. Everything is governed by smart contracts.
Why Escrow?
Buyer Protection: Funds are held in escrow until the buyer confirms the received goods/services.
Seller Assurance: Once the terms are met, funds are automatically released, eliminating delays.
Dispute Resolution: The smart contract mediates, making it fair for both parties.
üöÄ Key Features
Blockchain-based Escrow: Trustify ensures that funds are securely locked in the escrow contract until the terms of the agreement are met.
Rust Backend: The backend of Trustify is built using Rust, making it highly secure, fast, and reliable.
Vue.js Frontend: A sleek and modern interface built using Vue.js provides users with an intuitive experience.
ICP Hosting: The project is hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), ensuring decentralized and scalable infrastructure.
üîß Tech Stack
Frontend:
