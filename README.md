Project Overview
Trustify is built to reduce risks in online transactions by implementing an escrow service that locks funds until the terms of a deal are met. With blockchain technology at its core, Trustify ensures:

Security: Transactions are recorded on a tamper-proof blockchain.
Transparency: Both buyers and sellers can track the progress of their transactions in real-time.
Decentralization: Trustify operates without intermediaries, relying on smart contracts to mediate all operations.
Why Use Trustify?
Buyer Protection: Funds are held securely until the buyer confirms that the agreed goods or services have been delivered.
Seller Assurance: Sellers are assured that once they fulfill the terms, they will receive their payment without delays.
Blockchain-Powered: All actions are governed by smart contracts that eliminate bias, disputes, and central authority.
Key Features
Blockchain-based Escrow: Funds are securely held in escrow until the conditions of the agreement are satisfied.
Rust Backend: The core logic is implemented in Rust for performance, security, and reliability.
Vue.js Frontend: A user-friendly interface built using Vue.js for a seamless experience.
ICP Hosting: Trustify is hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), ensuring decentralized infrastructure and scalability.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
Vue.js: For building responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: For responsive, modern design and layout.
Backend:
Rust: The smart contract logic is built in Rust for secure and fast execution.

How It Works
Create Escrow: A buyer creates an escrow by defining the terms of the agreement.
Seller Agreement: The seller reviews and agrees to the terms.
Fund Escrow: The buyer deposits the required amount into the escrow.
Complete Transaction: The seller fulfills their end of the deal.
Release Funds: Once the buyer confirms receipt, funds are automatically released to the seller.
Dispute Resolution: If there are any disputes, the smart contract handles them according to predefined rules.
